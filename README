This is a ray tracing renderer following the tutorial Ray Tracing in One Weekend(https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

Generate a random scene with spheres of different material(glass, metal and diffusing material).

To build the executable:
bazel build //:main
To run the executable:
./bazel-bin/main

Or simply
bazel run //:main

The image is in .ppm format, I manually export it in .png format to be displayed in github.
